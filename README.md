jgit-cookbook
Build Status Gradle Status Tag

Provides examples and code snippets for the JGit Java Git implementation.

The JGit framework is rich and diverse, it has two layers, a low-level api and a higher-level set of porcelain commands. This can be a bit intimidating at first as there are lots of classes, some of which are not relevant for most tasks.

This project tries to provide a collection of ready-to-run snippets which provide a quick start for building functionality using JGit.

Please make sure to take a look at the nicely written introduction and also use the existing JavaDoc and the User Guide as well, as they are well done and provide detailed information and a general overview of JGit respectively.

Note: Please use sites such as http://stackoverflow.com for general questions about JGit usage, not issues in this project. Issues should be used for problems with snippets and suggestions of missing snippets. Snippets from good answers on stackoverflow can then be included here, naturally.

Getting started
Grab it
git clone https://github.com/centic9/jgit-cookbook.git
Build it and create Eclipse project files
When using Maven
mvn dependency:sources eclipse:eclipse package
When using Gradle
./gradlew eclipse check
Run it
Each snippet is a small standalone Java application, so you can simply  
import the project into your favourite IDE and execute the snippets there.
Currently the following snippets are available
General Repository handling
Open an existing repository
Create a new repository
Porcelain commands
Initialize a new repository
Add a new file to the index
Commit a file to an existing repository
Commit all changes
List commits (i.e. Log)
List all tags in a repository
List all branches in a repository
List all commits in a repository
List uncommitted changes of a repository
Create and delete branches
Create and delete tags
List all tags applied on a branch
Revert a modified tracked file back to its original state in most recent commit
Return diff between two branches
Show diff of changes to a file between two revs
Show diff of changes to all files between two commits
Show diff of changes to a file between two commits when the file has been renamed
Show Status
Store contents of branch into a compressed file
Write contents of branch into a compressed file using a custom archive format
Blame, i.e. find out which commit changed specific lines in a file
Add and list Notes attached to commits
List available Notes
Clean all untracked files
Create, list, apply and drop stashes
Run garbage collection
Blame, i.e. retrieve information who last changed which line in a file
Merge changes from a branch
List changed files between two commits
List changed files in index
List changed files in checkout
Commands working with remote repositories

List remote heads/tags without a local clone
Fetch from remote repositories
Fetch from remote repositories and use 'prune' to remove outdated remote branches/tags
Fetch from remote repositories via SSH protocol
Clone a remote repository via SSH protocol and username/password credentials
Rebase onto an upstream branch
Using InMemoryRepository to clone a Git repo in-memory and work from there
Checkout a PR from GitHub
Push to a remote repository
Set remote tracking branch
Low-level API
Get the SHA-1 ref from a name, e.g. refs/heads/master
Get the commit-object from a name or a SHA-1
Get the commit-message
Get the tree-object from a commit-object, name or SHA-1
Read the contents of a file/blob
Get the tag-object from a name or a SHA-1
Resolve complex references, e.g. HEAD^^ to a SHA-1
Iterate over the commits on a branch
Iterate over a range of commits
Read contents of a specific file from a specific commit
List remotes configured for the current repository
Print out user information from Git
Read file attributes, e.g. executable state, file or directory, size, ...
Use class BranchTrackingStatus to retrieve number of commits ahead/behind compared to remote branches
Check if commits on other branches are merged into a given branch
List files in a directory as-of a specific commit or a tag
Iterate over files of a commit recursively
Iterate over files of a commit non-recursively
Find all commits that are reachable via tags, branches, remotes, HEADs, ...
GitServlet
There is a standalone sub-project in directory httpserver which starts up a simple HTTP Git server based on the JGit GitServlet.
Just import the project in your IDE and start up the Main application, see the Comments in the code for more details.

Another simple way to start the sample-server is to run ./gradlew run in the httpserver-directory.
